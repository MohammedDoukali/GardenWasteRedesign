# Skip Size Selection Page – Redesign

## Overview

This is a redesigned version of the "Select Skip Size" page based on an outdated design provided by the company. The goal was to modernize the UI, enhance user experience, and improve responsiveness on all screen sizes.

## Key Changes

- **New Color Theme**: A golden color scheme was chosen to reflect the actual skip color, improving brand consistency and visual appeal.
- **Selected Skip Highlight**: When a skip is selected, it now has a clear golden border, a tick icon at the top right, and a button labeled “Selected” at the bottom for immediate visual feedback.
- **Skip Cards Redesign**: Each card now displays:
  - Skip size and label (e.g., “Best Value”)
  - Base price and VAT (with breakdown)
  - Hire period
- **Responsive Step Bar**: The progress step bar is now fully responsive. On small screens, it adjusts to fit without needing horizontal scrolling, improving usability.
- **Bottom Summary Panel**: Shows the selected skip size, hire period, and total cost clearly before moving to the next step.
- **Improved CTA**: The "Continue to Permit Check" button is now more visible and professionally styled.
- **Back Button**: A back button was added at the top left of the page, allowing users to return easily to the previous step in the process.

- Enhance mobile user experience with better responsiveness
- Help users complete the process with minimal confusion
